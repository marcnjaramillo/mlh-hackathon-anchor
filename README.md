# Fellows meet fellows

Check it out [live](https://fellows-meet-fellows.vercel.app/)

## What it does
This is a webapp hosted on Solana that allows fellows to upload their photos, a short introduction and their social media links, so we can all get to know each other a bit better in this remote workplace. 

## How we built it
The backend is a program hosted on the Solana blockchain and the front end was built using React. 

## What we learned
So much!! This was the first Solana project for Marc and I, so all the technologies were brand new to us. 

## What's next for Fellows meet fellows
We are hoping to polish this up in the near future so it is usable for other fellows/ pods
